AspNetMvcCRUDWithAjaxExample
============================

An example of a simple CRUD website with an ajax call using Asp.net MVC.

I created a one table, 6 column Sql Compact database and then used Entity Framework's Model-First approach to generate an edmx model.

Next I used the edmx model to add a ADO.NET DbContext Generator to create the data infrastructure.

The biggest challenge was re-installing visual studio 2010, in this case Visual Web Developer 2010 express, and all the necessary packages.
